# Teste Infor

This is an official npm starter turborepo.

## What's inside?

This turborepo uses [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) as a package manager. It includes the following packages/apps:

### Apps and Packages

- `api`: a [node](https://nodejs.org) app
- `web`: another [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app
- `ui`: a stub React component library shared by both `web` and `docs` applications
- `eslint-config-custom`: `eslint` configurations (includes `eslint-config-next` and `eslint-config-prettier`)
- `tsconfig`: `tsconfig.json`s used throughout the monorepo

Each package/app is 100% [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### Technologies

## API

- `Prisma`
- `Express`
- `Celebrate`
- `jsonwebtoken`
- `Bcrypt`

### Build

To build all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
npm run build
```

### Develop

To develop all apps and packages, run the following command:

```
cd my-turborepo
npm run dev
```

### Remote Caching

Turborepo can use a technique known as [Remote Caching](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/core-concepts/remote-caching) to share cache artifacts across machines, enabling you to share build caches with your team and CI/CD pipelines.

By default, Turborepo will cache locally. To enable Remote Caching you will need an account with Vercel. If you don't have an account you can [create one](https://vercel.com/signup), then enter the following commands:

```
cd my-turborepo
npx turbo login
```
